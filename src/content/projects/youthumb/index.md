A simple web app that allows you to download YouTube thumbnails by pasting the video URL.
It was originally built using Python and Django. But, has over the years been rewritten in various languages and frameworks.
I have mostly used it as learning playground for new languages and frameworks.
Different variations include:
- Python and Django
- Node.js and Express
- React and Static page on AWS
- Next.js and SST on AWS
- Go with standard library for http and templates
