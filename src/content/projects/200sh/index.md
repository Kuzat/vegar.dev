A simple uptime monitor SaaS that I built to monitor my personal projects. It was also built to experiment and try
out PHP and Laravel. It's very simple and only has the basic features needed to monitor a website. More features
were planned, but never implemented. It was a fun project to build and I learned a lot about Laravel and PHP.
After building it I realized that PHP and Laravel was not for me, and I have since moved on to other projects.
